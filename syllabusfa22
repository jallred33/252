## **Learning Outcomes**

Students who successfully complete the course will:

- Extend close reading skills developed in ENGL 220 via frequent practice with analytic writing.
- Develop new skills in decoding secondary literature from various methodological and theoretical traditions.
- Integrate literary arguments into existing critical conversations in writing.
- Gain basic familiarity with the genre of "climate fiction" within the field of "environmental literature" and the broader context of the "anthropocene" as articulated in environmental studies

## **Course Description:**
This course, “The Novel and the Anthropocene,” introduces students to central concepts and methods of literary study. It links the close reading skills one masters in ENGL 220 to more sophisticated modes of critical thinking and writing one finds in the best recent scholarship. We will learn to read critical articles alongside “primary texts” (here, novels), unpacking their assumptions and methodologies, questioning their arguments, and applying their insights to our own reading and writing. To develop these skills, we will explore a few recent novels that grapple with climate change and other aspects of the “anthropocene,” the ongoing geological era defined by human-borne ecological change. Authors may include: Ben Lerner, Richard Powers, and Octavia Butler. Course requirements: enthusiastic participation, several brief informal writing assignments, a take-home midterm, and a final research project. You can get a decent sense of the course structure from the site, though the topic, obviously, has changed: indivisible.commons.gc.cuny.edu.

## Technology:

We will use open-access resources via the CUNY Academic Commons rather than BlackBoard this term. You will use:

* a course blog (using WordPress) for sharing informal writing with classmates and engaging in intellectual exchange about course materials with me and with each other.
* a course "group" that is basically a listserv and document archive for .pdfs and other materials you'll need.

There's a bit of work to get up and going on the Commons, and we'll cover those steps together in class. Most students find it a fun and engaging space for reading/writing, with more curb appeal and flexibility than Bb!

## Writing and Research Help

In addition to course assignments and instruction, the [Reading/Writing Center](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/rwc) can help you to improve your literacy skills and develop your writing style.

For research help, Hunter College Libraries provide online databases and other remote resources. Hunter librarians can help you leverage these resources for your projects. Here are some ways:

- [Five ways to contact the librar](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/ask-a-librarian)y
- Contact English subject librarian Jennifer Newman at jn1314@hunter.cuny.edu.

## Attendance/Participation:

Faculty are required to certify student attendance. You are urged to keep abreast of any attendance requirements that may be set by Hunter, government agencies or others with regards to qualification for financial aid, fulltime status, etc.

Except as stipulated by Hunter policy, your course grades may be based on assignments (which may include presentations and participation in group activities) and in-class activities, but not on attendance *per se*. I do expect regular, vigorous participation in our discussions and other activities. Having said, that, I recognize that there may be factors beyond your control that inhibit the quality and quantity of your participation (e.g., childcare issues, sickness, etc.). Please reach out if you have issues and plan ahead when possible.

Please do your best to contact me if you cannot take part in the course due to illness or an emergency. Let me know if you will be unable to access the course site or the internet for a week or more. Depending on the circumstances it may be possible to schedule alternatives to activities that you miss. Remember that to be excused, medicals must indicate that you were incapable of working on the assignment while confined.
