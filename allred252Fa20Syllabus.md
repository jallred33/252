**Learning Outcomes**
Students who successfully complete the course will:

- Extend close reading skills developed in ENGL 220 via frequent practice with analytic writing.
- Develop new skills in decoding secondary literature from various methodological and theoretical traditions.
- Integrate literary arguments into existing critical conversations in writing.
- Gain basic familiarity with theories of visual culture and major themes in twentieth-century African-American writing.
## Course Description:

This course, " In/di/visible: Race and Vision, 1900-present," introduces students to central concepts and methods of literary study. It links the close reading skills one masters in ENGL 220 to more sophisticated modes of critical thinking and writing one finds in the best recent scholarship. We will learn to read critical articles alongside "primary texts" like novels and poems, unpacking their assumptions and methodologies, questioning their arguments, and applying their insights to our own reading and writing. To develop these skills, we will explore a few twentieth-century prose works that thematize the relationship between race and vision in American culture, including works by Du Bois, Hurston, Ellison, Morrison, and Rankine. Course requirements: enthusiastic participation, several brief informal writing assignments, a take-home midterm, and a final research project. You can get a decent sense of the course from the site, though the particulars are subject to change: indivisible.commons.gc.cuny.edu.

## Technology:

You will need reliable and frequent access to a computer (and/or phone and/or tablet for the Zooms) and to the Internet. If you do not have access to a reliable computer with Internet connection, loaner laptops are available through the Technology Loan Program. If possible, request a PC or Apple laptop. Information on free or low-cost internet service is available at [Internet & Wifi](https://ww2.hunter.cuny.edu/students/student-life/emergency-support-and-resources/internet-wifi-resources/).

If you still do not have access to the Internet contact me so that we can arrange for alternative means of accessing the course materials and other resources for you to successfully take part in this course.

For help with technical issues that you cannot resolve on your own contact the Student Help Desk (studenthelpdesk@hunter.cuny.edu) or (212) 650-3624.

For guidelines on how to participate in our regular Zoom sessions most successfully, [see this one-pager](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/vfzx7pq4snm5lvay9ba4a/Zoom-Discussion-Guidelines.paper?dl=0&rlkey=5tciwy29nexhu2sqjx30njplp).


## Writing and Research Help

In addition to course assignments and instruction, the [Reading/Writing Center](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/rwc) can help you to improve your literacy skills and develop your writing style.

For research help, Hunter College Libraries provide online databases and other remote resources. Hunter librarians can help you leverage these resources for your projects. Here are some ways:

- [Five ways to contact the librar](https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/ask-a-librarian)y
- Contact English subject librarian Jennifer Newman at jn1314@hunter.cuny.edu. We’ll work with her later in the term.
- Instructions to access the Hunter Library from off-campus are here: https://library.hunter.cuny.edu/remote-access.

For more ways to get help, consult [Academic Support & Tutoring](http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/onestop/advising/academic-support-tutoring-1).

## Attendance/Participation:

Faculty are required to certify student attendance. You are urged to keep abreast of any attendance requirements that may be set by Hunter, government agencies or others with regards to qualification for financial aid, fulltime status, etc.

Except as stipulated by Hunter policy, your course grades may be based on assignments (which may include presentations and participation in group activities) and interaction with online lectures, but not on attendance *per se*. I do expect regular, vigorous participation in our discussions and other synchronous activities. Having said, that, I recognize that there may be factors beyond your control that inhibit the quality and quantity of your participation (e.g., childcare issues, lack of adequate quiet space, low bandwidth, old/dysfunctional technology). Please reach out if you have issues and take advantage of Zoom’s flexible modes of access (e.g., phoning in rather than video conferencing; not turning on video if you’re in a difficult space or have low bandwidth). 

Please do your best to contact me if you cannot take part in the course due to illness or an emergency. Let me know if you will be unable to access the course site or the internet for a week or more. Depending on the circumstances it may be possible to schedule alternatives to activities that you miss. Remember that to be excused, medicals must indicate that you were incapable of working on the assignment while confined.
